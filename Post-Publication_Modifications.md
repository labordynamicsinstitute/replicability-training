# Author Submitted Post-Publication Modifications

There are occasional situations which involve authors submitting changes to their OpenICPSR deposit after publication. For these cases, an issue should be created (from email, typically). 

## Preliminaries

In cases where the original deposit was created prior to July 2019, the deposit ownership should be assigned to the corresponding author. 

Also ensure that the required fields (JEL and Manuscript number) are filled out.

## JIRA fields

- Journal
- Manuscript Number
- openICPSR repository
- MCStatus should be "Update" ("revision" is also acceptable)

## Assignment

Assign to Assistant, or an RA with experience in revisions.

## Transition

There is a specific transition in the Jira workflow called "Author submitted post-publication modifications" which enables the user to move the issue from "Assigned" straight to "Pending openICPSR changes."

## Checks

Ensure that authors have "submitted to AEA", and that an updated README as well as any updated files are present.

In these cases we are only checking to verify what specific changes were made and that these changes are reflected in an updated README. The email correspondence should be checked, as should the logs. There should be no additional directories within the deposit called "update" or similar. See the revision policy.

The resolution should always be "Evaluation only."

## Moving to publication

From here on, follow the usual workflow to publication of the deposit. In general, the AEA Data Editor, not the Editorial Office will publish the deposit.

## Communication to AEA Editorial Office

See Revision policy. If the version of record is changed, this needs to be notified to the editorial office, so they can update the records. If a new version is created, no further action is needed.
