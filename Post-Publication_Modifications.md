# Author Submitted Post-Publication Modifications

There are occasional situations which involve authors submitting changes to their OpenICPSR deposit after publication. For these cases, there is a specific transition in the Jira workflow called "Author submitted post-publication modifications" which enables the user to move the issue from "Assigned" straight to "Pending openICPSR changes."

This transition is only enabled when the issue contains an MCStatus = "Revision" or "Update" (but not CA or RR).

In these cases we are only checking to verify what specific changes were made and that these changes are reflected in an updated README. For this reason, the resolution should always be "Evaluation only."
