## For R&Rs
- For R&R's, the AEA editorial office has not changed the criteria for our response. Your options will be:
   - Accept 
   - Revise and Resubmit (this is synonymous to `Conditional Accept`)
   - No Recommendation
   - Reject 
 The recommendation should be one of these options 

# Preparing Deposit for Publication
For "Accept" or "Accept with changes", we move the issue to "Prepare for publication". Otherwise, you are done.

1. Open the issue on Jira
2. Click on the "Prepare for publication" transition
   - FOR ACCEPT WITH CHANGES: If there is special information to be added to the openICPSR repository, click on the "Wait for response on ICPSR" transition to "Pending openICPSR changes"
3. In the pop-up, you should have all the necessary information.
   - Note: links in the pop-up window are not clickable: double-click, then use right-click to "Open in New Tab"
   - `Code provenance` should point to openICPSR. If not, go to the final step.
   - Make a note of the issue number again.
4. on openICPSR,
   - FOR ACCEPT WITH CHANGES: sometimes there may be a special message, and you should NOT post the standard acceptance language. Instead, post the special message to openICPSR and include the lines here:
   > Once completed, do not resubmit to Manuscript Central. Please use the openICPSR Project Communication log, specifying AEAREP-xxx.
   - remove any RAs from the Share list (leave anybody who is on there!)
   - post to the Communication log a standard message with the last few lines from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/master/sample-language-report.md. This generates an email message (copied to all admin privs) with the same text.
5. In your email, 
   - the email generated by openICPSR needs to be forwarded to *Jira queue email* with the **issue number** manually inserted into the subject line, and anything before the "From:" deleted. This will add it to the ticket.
6. Back in the Jira popup, finalize by clicking "OK". The issue should be moved to "Pending Publication" (which reassigns it to Jenna at the AEA editorial office).
