##  11:00 - 11:30 [Reproducible practices](Reproducible_practices.md)
  + The ideal directory structure (common sense, TIER, variants) 
  + The prototypical data flow
  + Naming data and programs
  + Structuring programs

##  11:30 - 12:00 [Code and documentation](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_code.html)
  + What do we consider to be "code"
  + Assessing the quality of the code documentation

  > LUNCH

##  12:30 - 1:00 [Data documentation](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_data.html)
  + Identifying all data
  + What is great / good / just-good-enough data documentation
  + Citing data!


## 1:00 - 2:00 Examples of Replicable Articles
  + [Good, Bad, and In the middle](replication_examples.md)


# A Walkthrough of Setting Up a Replication Example
 + [Example](replication_walkthrough.pdf)
 + Remember: git commit every few steps, git push at least once a day

# Specifics of the LDI Replication Lab (David)

##  The workflow for unpublished articles

For unpublished articles, the assignment of articles occurs through **Jira**
+ [Pre-publication workflow for unpublished articles](../jira-workflow-training.md)
+ Start by assessing the article, citations, data
+ Then follow the normal set up for replication (if needed, not always)
+ [Example](../jira_replication_example.pdf)

##  The workflow for published articles

For published articles, the list of articles to replicate is listed on a **Google Sheet**.

+ [Test case](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Setting_up_git)
+ [Post-publication workflow](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Training-Team)
