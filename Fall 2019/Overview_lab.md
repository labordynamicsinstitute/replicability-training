# Overview of the LDI Lab


## Conduct Pre-Publication Evaluation of Reproducibility and Quality of Supplemental Materials

The Lab performs pre-publication evaluation for the American Economic Association, i.e., prior to publication. Think of it as a "reviewer" of the data supplement.

- Analyze the provided materials - see [Verification guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html)
- Verify data citations
- Verify ability to post data (do the authors have the right to post the data?)
- If possible, attempt replication

## Conduct Post-Publication Evaluation of Reproducibility (when time permits)

We download articles and supplements, assess to what extent an undergraduate student can run the code that produces the analysis reported in the paper.

We have also in the past done an evaluation of the response of authors when the code is only available "upon request". Not currently an active project.
