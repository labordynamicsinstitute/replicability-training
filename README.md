prior to Training
------

Please have a look at the [list of tasks](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-curriculum/pre-training.html) that should be accomplished before the first meeting. 

---

Tentative Agenda
----------------

The training will start with an intensive day of lectures/discussions, followed by exercises that you will do on your own, with daily touch-base meetings.

Items that are **bolded** are live meetings (Zoom). Items that are *italicized* are in informal groups, but live. Other items are on your own time, but the time slot is the suggested time you should be doing them. 

> If you have not received an invitation and you think you should have, contact LDI.
