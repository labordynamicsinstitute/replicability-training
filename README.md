prior to Training
------

Please have a look at the [list of tasks](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-curriculum/pre-training.html) that should be accomplished before the first meeting. 

---

Tentative Agenda
----------------

The training will start with an intensive day of lectures/discussions, followed by exercises that you will do on your own, with daily touch-base meetings.

Items that are **bolded** are live meetings. Items that are *italicized* are in informal groups, but live (in person or on Zoom). Other items are on your own time, but the time slot is the suggested time you should be doing them. 

> If you have not received an invitation and you think you should have, contact LDI.
