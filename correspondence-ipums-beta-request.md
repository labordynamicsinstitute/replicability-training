Your replication package uses IPUMS data. Provision of extracts is required for sample (not full-count) files, and is compliant with IPUMS Terms of Use. 

For the extracts you generated, you should provide

- the dofile for read-in "usa_0028.do" and dct files
- for sample files, the actual extract (dat or dta files)

However, IPUMS is trialling an API for extracts, which allows a user to export the extract specification, and for a replicator to re-use the extract specification programmatically. We are able to convert your stored extract specification into a downloadable file. There are two ways forward for this:

-  you sign up for the beta (write to ipums+api@umn.edu and tell them you want to participate in the beta, and that the AEA Data Editor sent you)
- alternatively, you can give us permission to access your data extracts. We will then handle converting the extract and adding the files to your replication package.

Please contact the Data Editor (dataeditor@aeapubs.org) to let us know your choice of action.
