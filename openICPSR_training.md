# Training for using openICPSR
Typically pre-publication replications will have code and data stored on [openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea)

> Cornell replicators: You will need to set up an openICPSR account using your Cornell email.

## Basics of openICPSR
- Authors will create a draft deposit that contains the replication archive for their paper.
- Each deposit is identified with a six digit number.
- You will download the project and commit the code files to the corresponding Bitbucket repo.

## Downloading a project
- See the image below for how to download a project.

- Do not upload files to the projects.
- Do not share projects with others unless instructed otherwise.
