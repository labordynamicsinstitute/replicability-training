# Preparing a Legacy Deposit for Updates by Authors

Post-publication, authors may wish to make changes to their deposit. The authors should review the AEA policy on revisions [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions). 

A new Jira issue should be created to keep a record of all email corresponence and track progress. The issue can be transitioned from "Assigned" straight to "Pending openICPSR changes." See [here](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/blob/master/Post-Publication_Modifications.md) for guidance on this workflow transition.

Necessary steps from our end:
1. Request a transfer of deposit ownership from AEA to the author. They should receive a notification from OpenICPSR.
2. Share the deposit with all authors of the manuscript, giving them full rights (including the right to re-submit).
3. Once the authors have finished and re-submitted the deposit, we will need to check the deposit for completeness. This involves verifying any changes made do not violate the AEA revision policy and ensuring that they have updated the README to accurately reflect the new state of the deposit.
4. Take steps to prepare deposit for publication.


**Example of E-Mail Sent to Authors:**
```
In order for you to make the updates to the deposit, I have done the following:
•	I have requested a transfer of deposit ownership from the AEA to *author* (please let me know if you did not receive a notification from openICPSR)
•	I have shared the deposit with *co-authors*, with all rights (including the right to resubmit).

You should now update the deposit. 
•	The currently published V1 will remain available indefinitely, and will remain the version of record; the new version you are creating will be V2, and will be linked (in a very obvious way, with a banner) to V1
•	Do not create a second folder with "updated data" or similar; rather simply delete any files that are no longer necessary. What you see is what you will publish...
•	One suggestion: once you have updated the README, move it to the root folder (delete in /data/ReadMe.pdf, upload to /) - this improves visibility
•	Once you are done, we strongly suggest you also update the remaining metadata in the deposit (see https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea.html for guidance)
•	Once that is done, submit the deposit to us. We will check for completeness, and republish.

Let us know if you have any questions.
