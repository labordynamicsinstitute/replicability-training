If prompted about using sensitive or restricted data, please select No. Otherwise, this will take you to a window to sign up for a CRADC account instead, which is not necessary. If you encounter this issue, please email the [CISER help desk](https://ciser.cornell.edu/consulting/ciser-helpdesk/) asking them cancel the CRADC account request.

## Software to install on your laptop

- [x] Command line (PowerShell, or Terminal, your choice) - pre-installed
- [ ] Windows Remote Desktop (see above)
- [ ] Git command line tool ([download location](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Installing Git on your computer](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ldi-lab-standards/wiki/Setting-up-Git)
- [ ] Visual Studio Code ([download location](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), a powerful text editor

Other software is optional. You will use statistical software on other computers [that we will get you access to](Access_to_computers.md).

## Text editor vs. Word processor

You want to use a **text editor**, not a **word processor**. The difference: a **text editor** creates simple text files, no fancy formatting.

If you are creating code in Stata, Matlab, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an **IDE** = "Integrated Development Environment". That is OK. But remember that all such program code is a straight text file. 

General purpose text editors can view and edit them all, although they may lack some of the fancy features that make programming easier in the dedicated IDE.
