# Communication

## Medium

### Email
We use email (yes, we know ðŸ™„) through a mailing list

- Ask lots of questions
- Communicate with each other (answer each other's questions)

When you expect to be absent/ cannot handle a request in a timely fashion

- email Meredith and Lars

### Jira

For pre-publication tasks, we also use Jira. 

- you can comment on Jira in the web interface
- in the Jira app on your phone
- by response email

When you are assigned a task in Jira, and do not expect to be able to start work on it immediately, please let us know ASAP.

### Github

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki) with guidance, suggestions, tips and tricks. 

- look there first for answers
- if you get an answer by email, or figure it out yourself, add it to the FAQ

## Language

Don't write anything you wouldn't want your British aunt (or your mom, or your dad) to see. Write cleanly and concisely.

- much of what we write will be seen by others
- much of what we write is public (Wiki)
- the reports you write should be concise, and shareable (we expect to do minimal editing before sending it out to authors)

For reference: Authors who have seen the documents written by this group

- Thomas Piketty
- Esther Duflo
- John Abowd
- Janet Yellen
