## After the training

... the training continues.

You will be assigned two training cases, which you will be expected to work through. The answer for these is known. It's not a test - it's meant to provide you an opportunity to train all the concepts and methods we've shown you. Ask as many questions as you can.

The LDI Replication Lab meets every Monday, 5:30-6:30 PM. You will be expected to attend right away, to see how we organize and solve problems. 

About 7-10 days after the training, we will start assigning you real (new) cases, and your life as a LDI Replicator begins!
