# Instructions for to-be-published data with restrictions.

For instructions regarding privately provided confidential data, see elsewhere.

## Authors make openICPSR deposit

They should mark both "restriction" questions with "Yes". This marks the deposit as a restricted one. 

> This deposit only serves as a waypoint, and will not be published.

## AEA staff connect with ICPSR

Once author has submitted to AEA, AEA Staff send an email to deposit@icpsr.umich.edu with a link to the openICPSR deposit workspace.  The email should explain how this collection should be distributed.  

- secure download (the default)
- virtual enclave 
- physical enclave

and what the expected timeline is. 

This email goes to ICPSR Acquisitions staff, who can then review the data via the administrative workspace before anything is transferred to the ICPSR restricted deposit space.  They will communicate whether ICPSR can distribute the disclosive/sensitive data, what the distribution mechanism will be (secure download or virtual enclave or something even more restrictive, like the physical enclave), if there are special considerations, and what the expected timeline is for distributing it through main ICPSR.  

## Follow-up

Once the restricted deposit has been made public, the DOI needs to be communicated back to authors, editors, and coded in the openICPSR main deposit (where all code should be).

- AEA Staff: enter the DOI of the restricted ICPSR deposit as a "related publication" in the main openICPSR deposit.
