![Software usage](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/econ-program-usage-data/raw/master/aer_programs_by_year.png)

* Stata
* Matlab
* SAS
* a few others

You will need to understand how to run programs in the top two.
- load programs
- find log files, if any
- understand packages, where to find them, and how to debug

We will not provide you with specific training, check [CISER workshops](https://ciser.cornell.edu/workshops-at-culearn/) (free).
However, you will learn-by-doing here, and be exposed to a lot of very good (and sometimes bad) code.
