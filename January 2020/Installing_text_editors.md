# Installing Text Editors

You want to use a **text editor**, not a **word processor**. 

The difference: creates simple text files, no fancy formatting.

If you are creating code in Stata, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an **IDE** = "Integrated Development Environment"
