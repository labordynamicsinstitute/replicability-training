## Structure
Each team has a Team Leader, and multiple members. Some team members, including all Team Leaders, are pre-approvers

## Pre-approvers

Pre-approvers do the following tasks (see [Preapprovals](Preapprovals.md)) for  Preliminary Reports and Submitted Reports

- A first pass through Preliminary Reports, as well as Submitted Reports (other team members may also have a "pre-approver" role).
- Pre-approvers will write the Summary of each report, and style the report according to the [pre-approval guidelines](Preapprovals.md)
- Pre-approvers will assess the completeness of the issue information, including the Data Citation Report
- Pre-approvers will then move an issue to Preliminary Approval
- Team members remain responsible for fixing any issues identified by Pre-approvers


## Responsibilities of Team Leaders
Team Leaders are responsible for the following activities:
1. responding to member queries in a timely fashion
   - As soon as an issue arises, team members should bring it up with the team leader.
   - Team members remain responsible for making a note of any issues in the Jira issue
   - Team leaders will attempt to respond to issues first, and escalate to Graduate Assistant or Data Editor as necessary
2. leading status call-ins 
   - Team members will check in with Team leaders during the weekly (phone-only) status meetings
   - A senior member (Data Editor or Graduate Assistant) will also be on the call

## Responsibilities of Team Members
Team Members remain responsible for all aspects of the verification exercise:
- Accurately filling out the Jira issue information and the Data Citation Report
- Timely completion of verification, and timely moving of Jira issues into the right state
- Properly preparing the Report for submission
- Attendance at weekly in-person meetings (Monday) and phone status checks (Thursday)

## What Team Leaders are not
- Team Leaders are not personnel managers - all personnel issues (hours, etc.) are to be brought to the Data Editors attention 
- Team Leaders will neither chastise or praise Team members
