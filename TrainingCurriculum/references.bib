                policies for leading journals in economics on citations. As has
                previously been shown for other social sciences, there is an
                indication that the introduction of a replication policy
                increases the number of citations for a journal, presumably
                because readers use the data for their own investigation,
                possibly also because of a reliability effect. We see our
                results as an incentive for journals to introduce and enforce
                replication policies. Lamentably, only a minority of journals
                so far enforce their policies in a way that ensures
                replicability of most of the empirical work. With several
                examples we show how replication becomes difficult if policies
                are not enforced, and we suggest a pool of replicability
                editors as a solution: Since it would be too much to expect
                from journals to have experts for every single topic and
                software package, a joint effort of journals for such a pool of
                experts could help to ensure each empirical study is published
                with data, code, and instructions how to use them together such
                that all published results can easily be replicated. Reviewers
                can join the effort for replicability by following the
                principles of the Agenda for Open Research and refuse to
                comprehensively review empirical work that does not guarantee
                fully replicable empirical results. Further study is needed to
                investigate the citation impact on single articles, and we
                suggest a design for such research.",

                in economics. We identify a number of sources of progress,
                including the results of recent replication studies that have
                attempted to identify replication rates within the discipline.
                These studies generally find that replication rates are
                relatively low, though they may be higher for laboratory
                experiments in economics. We also identify two web-based
                resources for replications, the Replication in Economics wiki
                and The Replication Network. We then consider obstacles to
                undertaking replication studies in economics. Two obstacles are
                the lack of publishing outlets and difficulties in obtaining
                data and code for published studies. We identify journals that
                publish replication studies and that ``regularly'' include data
                and code as supplementary files for their published research.
                Finally, we highlight replication initiatives in psychology and
                political science, behind which economics appears to lag.
                Whether this is because the problems that beset those
                disciplines are less severe in economics, or because economics
                is more resistant to replications, is arguable.",

For computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated, the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%.

  abstract = {The roots of the modern concept of statistical confidentiality in the US federal statistical system can be traced directly back to the late nineteenth century efforts of statisticians to ensure full and accurate responses by businesses to statistical inquiries. Officials argued that such confidentiality guarantees were needed to ensure that the providers of enterprise and establishment data could be confident that the statistical agencies could not be forced to share their responses with others, such as regulatory or tax authorities, congressional investigators, prying journalists, and competitors, who might use this information to the detriment of the data provider. Nevertheless, over the years, the principle of statistical confidentiality with respect to information provided by businesses in statistical inquiries has been repeatedly challenged by other executive branch departments, independent regulatory agencies, the courts, Congress, and members of the public, with quite varied results.
The paper uses the published record and archival research to examine the history of challenges to statistical confidentiality, and the responses of the statistical agencies, the federal statistical system as a whole, including the office of the chief statistician in OMB (and its predecessors), executive department and independent non-statistical agencies, the courts, and Congress as well as representatives of the business community. Long-term trends and the implications for maintaining and strengthening the confidentiality protections for establishment- and enterprise-level business data provided to federal agencies for statistical purposes are discussed.},

A discrepant replication, in current usage of the term, can signal anything from an unremarkable disagreement over methods to scientific incompetence or misconduct. This paper proposes a standard for classifying one study as a replication of some other study. It is a standard that places the burden of proof on a study to demonstrate that it should have obtained identical results to the original, a conservative standard that is already used implicitly by many researchers. It contrasts this standard with decades of unsuccessful attempts to harmonize terminology, and argues that many prominent results described as replication tests should not be described as such. Adopting a conservative standard like this one can improve incentives for researchers, encouraging more and better replication tests.},

  abstract = {In response to widespread concerns about the integrity of research published in scholarly journals, several initiatives have emerged that are promoting research transparency through access to data underlying published scientific findings. Journal editors, in particular, have made a commitment to research transparency by issuing data policies that require authors to submit their data, code, and documentation to data repositories to allow for public access to the data. In the case of the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Data Replication Policy, the data also must undergo an independent verification process in which materials are reviewed for quality as a condition of final manuscript publication and acceptance.Aware of the specialized expertise of the data archives, AJPS called upon the Odum Institute Data Archive to provide a data review service that performs data curation and verification of replication datasets. This article presents a case study of the collaboration between AJPS and the Odum Institute Data Archive to develop a workflow that bridges manuscript publication and data review processes. The case study describes the challenges and the successes of the workflow integration, and offers lessons learned that may be applied by other data archives that are considering expanding their services to include data curation and verification services to support reproducible research.},

One prominent example of flexible work is the ride-sharing company Uber, which allows drivers to provide (or not provide) rides anytime they are willing to accept prevailing wages for providing this service. An Uber-style arrangement offers workers flexibility in both setting a customized work schedule and also adjusting the schedule from week to week, day to day, and hour to hour. Using data on hourly earnings for Uber drivers, we document the ways in which drivers utilize this real-time flexibility and we estimate the driver surplus generated by this flexibility. We estimate how drivers' reservation wages vary from hour to hour, which allows us to examine the surplus and supply implications of both flexible and traditional work arrangements. Our results indicate that, while the Uber relationship may have other drawbacks, Uber drivers benefit significantly from real-time flexibility, earning more than twice the surplus they would in less flexible arrangements. If required to supply labor inflexibly at prevailing wages, they would also reduce the hours they supply by more than two-thirds.},

However, research may be verified and built upon through a number of methods that go beyond basic replication, such as reanalysis and extension. In order for curation activities to properly support these progressions, this means broadening the discussion of what constitutes a primary research object so that all necessary components of a research project, including supplements, are discoverable and usable. This presentation will discuss the curation challenges in treating all types of data and code as primary research objects and strategies to overcome these obstacles.},

This article discusses how research data in psychology can be made accessible for reproducibility and reanalysis by describing practical ways to overcome barriers to data sharing. We examine key issues surrounding the sharing of data such as who owns research data, how to protect the confidentiality of the research participant, how to give appropriate credit to the data creator, how to deal with metadata and codebooks, how to address provenance, and other specifics such as versioning and file formats. The protection of research subjects is a fundamental obligation, and we explain frameworks and procedures designed to protect against the harms that may result from disclosure of confidential information. We also advocate greater recognition for data creators and the authors of program code used in the management and analysis of data. We argue that research data and program code are important scientific contributions that should be cited in the same way as publications. (PsycINFO Database Record},

The advent of scientific journals in the 17th century helped power the Scientific Revolution by allowing researchers to communicate across time and space, using the technologies of that era to generate reliable knowledge more quickly and efficiently. Harnessing today stunning, ongoing advances in information technologies, the global research enterprise and its stakeholders are moving toward a new open science ecosystem. Open science aims to ensure the free availability and usability of scholarly publications, the data that result from scholarly research, and the methodologies, including code or algorithms, that were used to generate those data. Science by Design is aimed at overcoming barriers and moving toward open science as the default approach across the research enterprise. This report explores specific examples of open science and discusses a range of challenges, focusing on stakeholder perspectives. It is meant to provide guidance to the research enterprise and its stakeholders as they build strategies for achieving open science and take the next steps.},

  abstract = {Social networks can shape many aspects of social and economic activity: migration and trade, job-seeking, innovation, consumer preferences and sentiment, public health, social mobility, and more. In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body 
of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an 
inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign
 country. Given Facebook's scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook's user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

Using both survey and administrative data, the authors provide the first comprehensive analysis of the labor market for Uber's driver-partners. Drivers appear to be attracted to the Uber platform largely because of the flexibility it offers, the level of compensation, and the fact that earnings per hour do not vary much based on the number of hours worked. Uber's driver-partners are more similar in terms of their age and education to the general workforce than to taxi drivers and chauffeurs. Most of Uber's driver-partners had full- or part-time employment before joining Uber, and many continue in those positions after starting to drive with the Uber platform, which makes the flexibility to set their own hours especially valuable. Drivers often cite the desire to smooth fluctuations in their income as one of their reasons for partnering with Uber.},
