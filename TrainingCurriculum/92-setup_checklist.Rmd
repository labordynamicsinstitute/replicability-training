# Setup Checklist {#checklist}

## Accounts you will need to sign up for (action required)

- [ ] CISER account (for computing access) - [Select "Apply for Research account" and list Lars as a sponsor.](https://ciser.cornell.edu/computing/request-an-account/) Do not select "*Request Secure Data Services account*". If prompted about using sensitive or restricted data, please select "*No*". Otherwise, this will take you to a window to sign up for a CRADC account instead, which is not necessary. If you encounter this issue, please email the [CISER help desk](https://ciser.cornell.edu/consulting/ciser-helpdesk/) asking them cancel the CRADC account request. 
   - If using a Mac and if "*Microsoft Remote Desktop*"  is not already installed on Mac, install [Remote Desktop Software from iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466) (not necessary on Windows, as it is pre-installed)
   - Once an account is set up, learn [How to log on to CISER](https://ciser.cornell.edu/computing/computing-help/how-to-login/) (also includes download links)
- [ ] You will need [openICPSR account](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/newacct), in order to download pre-publication materials. Please be sure to use your Cornell e-mail!

## Accounts you will be signed up for (no action required)

- [ ] Atlassian account
   - Bitbucket for access to the [internal Git repos](https://bitbucket.org/aeaverification/)
   - Jira account for the [internal issue tracker](https://aeadataeditors.atlassian.net/)
- [x] Email is used for the mailing list [ldi-lab-l@cornell.edu](mailto:ldi-lab-l@cornell.edu) 

## Software to install on your laptop

- [x] Command line (PowerShell, or Terminal, your choice) - pre-installed
- [ ] Windows Remote Desktop (see above)
- [ ] Git command line tool ([download the software](https://git-scm.com/downloads), then follow the guide on [Installing Git on your computer](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ldi-lab-standards/wiki/Setting-up-Git)
- [ ] Visual Studio Code ([download location](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), a powerful text editor
- [ ] Sourcetree (Git graphical interface optimized for Bitbucket) [download location](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (OPTIONAL)

Other software is optional. You will use statistical software on other computers [that we will get you access to](#Access_to_computers).

## Text editor vs. Word processor

You want to use a **text editor**, not a **word processor**. The difference: a **text editor** creates simple text files, without fancy formatting.

If you are creating code in Stata, Matlab, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an **IDE** = "Integrated Development Environment". That is OK. But remember that all such program code is a straight text file. 

General purpose text editors can view and edit them all, although they may lack some of the fancy features that make programming easier in the dedicated IDE.
