## Videoconferencing Rules and Etiquette

### What you will need
- Your laptop 
- A web camera (if not already on your laptop) 
- Headphones with a microphone 
- A quiet place

### Before entering the meeting

-   Ensure your technology works correctly BEFORE the meeting.
    - If you've switched devices, find out if they are working. There is a feature in Zoom to test your microphone and speakers. 
    - If you know your internet is slow, use phone dial-in for voice (and understand how that works)
-   Be on time (not really a videoconferencing rule - it's always a rule!).
    - Being late on a videoconferencing meeting may be as disruptive as walking past the presenter in a in-person meeting!
-   Be in a place where you are not disturbed
    - Don't videoconference from the coffee shop!
    - You need to be able to turn on camera (no cluttered bedroom background) and microphone (no chatter, no washing machine running).
-   Wear work-appropriate clothing.
    - Assume that you will be seen head-to-toe. 
-   Frame the camera correctly, and look into the camera
    - Be able to look into the camera, not to the side.
    - Assume you are having your wedding photo/ graduation photo/ photo for your grandma taken.
-   Have the right light.
    - Not too dark, not light from the background - we want to see you

### While in the meeting

- General rule:  if you wouldn't do it in a face-to-face meeting, then you shouldn't do it in a virtual one. 
- Speak clearly. Don't shout.
- Mute your microphone if not speaking. 
   - But also know when to unmute your microphone!
-   Look into the camera. Keep the camera on!
-   Pay attention. (That's why you keep the camera on!)
-   When hiccups occur, handle them silently.
    - if your call drops, dial-in again - and when you are back, don't shout "I'm back".
    - if your voice or video connection breaks up - switch to using the phone dial-in option (silently).
- It is OK to  
    - politely interrupt somebody if that person is particularly faint and you cannot hear them. 
    - if in a big room, introduce yourself when speaking (the far end may not always be able to clearly see your face). This is not necessary when in a single-person location.
- Don't carry on side conversations. 
    - Especially not with the microphone on!
- We may ask you to share your screen to help troubleshoot issues. Please familiarize yourself with this feature.
