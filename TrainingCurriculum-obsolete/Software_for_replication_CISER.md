# Software

Economists mostly use a few software packages:

![Software usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AEADataEditor/aea-supplement-migration/master/programs/figure_software_years_pct.png)

* Stata
* Matlab
* SAS
* a few others

You will need to understand how to run programs in the top two.
- load programs
- find log files, if any
- understand packages, where to find them, and how to debug

You are expected to be mostly self-sufficient in simple debugging - you are not expected to be a pro!

We will not provide you with specific training, check [CISER workshops](https://ciser.cornell.edu/workshops-at-culearn/) (free).
However, you will learn-by-doing here, and be exposed to a lot of very good (and sometimes bad) code.

## Access

You are not expected to have a license to run Stata or Matlab, but if you have one, you are free to use it. We will provide you with access to CISER computers where you can use the software free of charge.
