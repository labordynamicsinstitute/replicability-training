Part 2. LDI Replication Lab Code of Conduct

The LDI Replication Lab is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

It applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the LDI Replication Lab resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any LDI Replication Lab activity/platform include:

- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation

- the display of sexual or violent images  
- unwelcome sexual attention  
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact  
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications

Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any LDI Replication Lab activity and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to stop any activity they may be involved in, leave the platform, or engage university mechanisms to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.
