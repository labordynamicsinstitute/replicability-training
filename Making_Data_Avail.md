# Requesting Restricted-Access Data from Authors

For cases where the author(s) have indicated on the DCAF that they can make restricted-access data available to the Data Editor privately, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the following directory in Box: "Box/Office of AEA Data Editor/Restricted-Access-Data/"
2. Create a new subfolder corresponding to the Jira issue (i.e. `aearep-1234`). 
3. Create a [file request](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045304813-Using-File-Request-to-get-Content-from-Anyone) within the newly created subfolder (only one file request is permitted per folder).  
4. Copy the file request link.
5. Email the authors to request that they upload the restricted-access data files to Box using the template blow:


Dr. *Author*,

We received a request to conduct the AEA reproducibility check for your manuscript entitled "X." On the Data and Code Availability form which you submitted it was indicated that the data can be made available to the Data Editor privately. Would it be possible for you to provide the *X* data so that we may proceed to verify the reproducibility of the entire replication package? The data would not be published, and would be deleted by us once we have completed our process. Our preferred sharing method is a Box File Request (specific to your manuscript), the link for which can be found below, but can alternatively happen via Dropbox or similar means, and should be compliant with your data use agreement.

Box File Request (navigate to the link below and upload the file(s)):
