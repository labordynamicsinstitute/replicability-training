# Template Data Request

The template email below is for cases where the author(s) have indicated on the DCAF that they can make restricted-access data available to the Data Editor privately.


Dr. *Author*,

We received a request to conduct the AEA reproducibility check for your manuscript entitled "X." On the Data and Code Availability form which you submitted it was indicated that the data can be made available to the Data Editor privately. Would it be possible for you to provide the *X* data so that we may proceed to verify the reproducibility of the entire replication package? The data would not be published, and would be deleted by us once we have completed our process. Sharing can happen via Dropbox or similar means, and should be compliant with your data use agreement.

Please see the link below for guidance on sharing restricted data with the Data Editor. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.
