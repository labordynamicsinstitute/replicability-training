##  Overview
  + [What is reproducibility and why do we care](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/57256/Vilhuber-BuBa-Mai2018-2154-with-references.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)
  + [What is the state of reproducibility in economics](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/aej-applied-replications/raw/master/text/presentation/bitss_slides_12.10.18.pptx)
  + What will you be doing in this Lab

##  Technical setup
Providing you with the tools to do replicable science right, and efficiently.
  + The [Command Line](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/computing4economists/Git_CL_Slides/Slides_CommandLine.pdf)
  + The [basics of Git](Basics_of_Git.md) ([Cheatsheet for Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet))
    + [Installing Git on your computer](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ldi-lab-standards/wiki/Setting-up-Git)

    + Text editors: [Atom](https://atom.io), [MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), others.
  + Cornell-specific:
    + [Access to computers](Access_to_computers.md)
    + The role of Bitbucket, Google Drive
  + [Software you will use](Software_for_replication.md)

##  [Reproducible practices](Reproducible_practices.md)
  + The ideal directory structure (common sense, TIER, variants) 
  + The prototypical data flow
  + Naming data and programs
  + Structuring programs

##  [Data documentation](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/blob/master/Requested_information_data.md)
  + What is great data documentation
  + What is good data documentation
  + What is just-good-enough data documentation
  + Citing data!

##  [Code and documentation](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/blob/master/Requested_information_code.md)
  + What do we consider to be "code"
  + Assessing the quality of the code documentation
  + How to modify code for replicability/verification

## Verifying what you have learned
  + How to replicate in a replicable fashion
  + Examples of (great) (good) (bad) replicable articles

# The Next Level

## Incorporating good curation practices into your workflow
  + What is curation?
  + How do librarians curate?
  + How can individual scientists curate? Hands-on!
  + Publish your data

## Incorporating good programming practices into your workflow
  + Robust programming (very simple)
  + Including sanity checks
  + Programming for re-use and scalability
  + Curating your programs - going beyond Github & Co.
  + Publish your code
    + Best practices
    + Good enough practices
    + Tools and assistance

## Protecting your intellectual property 
  + Tensions between Open Access, Open Source, and IP
  + Copyright
  + Licenses
    + For your data and databases
    + For your software and code
