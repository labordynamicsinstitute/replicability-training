##  Overview
  + [What is reproducibility and why do we care] LARS CPC+France 15min talk

  + What will you be doing in this Lab (LARS)

##  Technical setup
Providing you with the tools to do replicable science right, and efficiently.
  + The [Command Line](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/computing4economists/Git_CL_Slides/Slides_CommandLine.pdf)
  + The [basics of Git](Basics_of_Git.md) ([Cheatsheet for Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet))
    + [Installing Git on your computer](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ldi-lab-standards/wiki/Setting-up-Git)
    + Testing that Git works
  + The [basics of Markdown](Basics_of_Markdown.md) ([Online Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [Printable Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf))
    + Installing Text editors:  [MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io), others.
  + Cornell-specific:
    + Get [Access to computers](Access_to_computers.md)
    + The role of Bitbucket, Google Drive (Lars will draw diagram)
  + [Software you will use](Software_for_replication.md)

##  [Reproducible practices](Reproducible_practices.md)
  + The ideal directory structure (common sense, TIER, variants) 
  + The prototypical data flow
  + Naming data and programs
  + Structuring programs

##  [Data documentation](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_data.html)
  + What is great data documentation
  + What is good data documentation
  + What is just-good-enough data documentation
  + Citing data!

##  [Code and documentation](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_code.html)
  + What do we consider to be "code"
  + Assessing the quality of the code documentation
  + How to modify code for replicability/verification
  
## Examples of Replicable Articles
  + [Good, Bad, and In the middle](replication_examples.md)

# A Walkthrough of Setting Up a Replication Example (David)
- Verifying what you have learned
- Git commit every few steps
- Git push at least once a day

# Specifics of the LDI Replication Lab

##  [Privacy](Privacy.md)
  + Your Privacy
  + The privacy of authors

## What we are looking for (David)

+ [Examples (not public)](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-guidance-internal/blob/master/Examples_post_publication.md)

##  The workflow for published articles (David)

For published articles, the list of articles to replicate is listed on a **Google Sheet**.

+ [Test case](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Setting_up_git)
+ [Post-publication workflow](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Training-Team)

##  The workflow for unpublished articles (Lars)

For unpublished articles, the assignment of articles occurs through **Jira**
+ [Pre-publication workflow for unpublished articles](../jira-workflow-training.md)
+ Start by assessing the article, citations, data
+ Then follow the normal set up for replication (if needed, not always)
